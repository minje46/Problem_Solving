# Problem_Solving
**Solve the bunch of algorithm problems.**

- Some problems on each level (step by step)
- Each numbered problems of  diverse algorithm.

# Goal

**Solve the algorithm problem everyday at least one since 2019.**

**Get A+ score on SW Expert test.**

# Special problems

**These problems were so hard to solve or it was handled with special(new) concept of algorithm.**
